_printf(3) - printf manual page

NAME
	_printf
SYNOPSIS
	#include "main.h"

	int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
	The function _printf() displays output to the standard output stream 
	according to a given format as outlined below.

	The function basically writes using the write() function to output to the stdout.

	The function is equivalent to printf() function as provided in the stdio.h library.
	
	
Format of the format string
	The format string is a character string, enclosed within a double quote with a percentage
	symbol directly before the string.

	The format string comprises of 0 or more instructions: characters that are copied in their
	 original state to the output stream and conversion specifiers, and they each result to 
	processing zero or more subsequent argument. Each of these conversion specification is 
	introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.

	The syntax of a coversion specification is this:

	%conversion

	The right coversion specifier corresponding to the right amount of argument must be used
	to obtain the right output.
	To print an integer variable named num:

	_printf("%d", num);

Conversion specifiers
	This is a character the specifies what tye of conversion should be applied.

	d, i	Converts an int argument to a signed decimal.

	o	Converts an unsigned int argument to an unsigned octal.
	
	u	Converts an unsigned int argument to an unsigned decimal.

	x, X	(x) converts an unsigned int argument to an unsigned Hexadecimal with the letters
		(abcdef). (X) converts an unsigned int argument to an unsigned Hexadecimal with 
		the letters (ABCDEF)

	b	Converts an unsigned int to unsigned binary.

RETURN VALUE

	Upon success, the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end 
	output of a string)

	If an output error is encoutered, a negative value is returned.

BUGS

	No known bugs at the time of this documentation.

EXAMPLE

#include "main.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 *Return: Always 0
 */

int main(void)
{
	/*declare an integer length to hold the return value of _printf*/
	int len;

	/*Assign a value to the variable length*/
	len = _printf("This is a string.\n");
	/*display the decimal value of len to the stdout*/
	 _printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len, len);
	/*print out a char*/
	_printf("Char: [%c]\n", 'B');

	/*return 0 on success*/
	return (0);
}
